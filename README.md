# Predictive Risk Modeling: Customer Classification using Logistic Regression

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning (Logistic Regression) for predictive risk analysis and customer classification. The objective is to build a robust statistical model capable of predicting a binary outcome (e.g., customer purchase or default risk) based on demographic and financial variables (age, gender, salary).

This model showcases the ability to translate raw data into actionable insights for underwriting, marketing, and financial planning.

## 🛠️ Key Methodologies and Tools

The analysis was executed in a Python environment, highlighting the following statistical and data science techniques:

* **Data Preprocessing:** Variables were standardized using the $(x_i - \text{mean}) / \text{SD}$ method to ensure all features are on a comparable scale, preventing scale bias in the model.
* **Logistic Regression:** Implementation of this core predictive model for client classification.
* **Model Validation:** Thorough validation using two key steps:
    1.  Calculating **Classification Accuracy** on both training and testing datasets.
    2.  Generating the **Confusion Matrix** to understand the type I and type II errors and evaluate model performance beyond simple accuracy.

## 📊 Demonstrated Value

The project proves proficiency in core areas highly valued in a Financial Analyst role:

* **Predictive Analytics:** Direct experience in building, training, and testing predictive models for risk assessment.
* **Statistical Rigor:** Understanding the importance of data preparation (standardization) and robust model validation metrics (Confusion Matrix).
* **Translating Analysis to Business:** Ability to use a predictive model to directly inform business decisions, such as identifying high-risk or high-value clients.

## ✨ Technical Skills Showcased
* **Python** (for machine learning model implementation)
* **Statistical Analysis**
* **Data Preprocessing**
